  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence and 10-year outcomes of frailty in older adults in relation to deficit accumulation.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: The National Population Health Survey of Canada, with frailty estimated at baseline (1994/95) and mortality follow-up to 2004/05.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (N=2,740, 60.8\% women) aged 65 to 102 from 10 Canadian provinces. During the 10-year follow-up, 1,208 died.
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported health information was used to construct a frailty index (Frailty Index) as a proportion of deficits accumulated in individuals. The main outcome measure was mortality.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty increased with age in men and women (correlation coefficient=0.955-0.994, P$<$.001). The Frailty Index estimated that 622 (22.7\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=21.0-24.4\%) of the sample was frail. Frailty was more common in women (25.3\%, 95\% CI=23.2-27.5\%) than in men (18.6\%, 95\% CI=15.9-21.3\%). For those aged 85 and older, the Frailty Index identified 39.1\% (95\% CI=31.3-46.9\%) of men as frail, compared with 45.1\% (95\% CI=39.7-50.5\%) of women. Frailty significantly increased the risk of death, with an age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for the Frailty Index of 1.57 (95\% CI=1.41-1.74).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of frailty increases with age and at any age lessens survival. The Frailty Index approach readily identifies frail people at risk of death, presumably because of its use of multiple health deficits in multidimensional domains.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To define frailty using simple indicators; to identify risk factors for frailty as targets for prevention; and to investigate the predictive validity of this frailty classification for death, hospitalization, hip fracture, and activity of daily living (ADL) disability.
DESIGN: Prospective study, the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study.
SETTING: Forty U.S. clinical centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty thousand six hundred fifty-seven women aged 65 to 79 at baseline.
MEASUREMENTS: Components of frailty included self-reported muscle weakness/impaired walking, exhaustion, low physical activity, and unintended weight loss between baseline and 3 years of follow-up. Death, hip fractures, ADL disability, and hospitalizations were ascertained during an average of 5.9 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: Baseline frailty was classified in 16.3\% of participants, and incident frailty at 3-years was 14.8\%. Older age, chronic conditions, smoking, and depressive symptom score were positively associated with incident frailty, whereas income, moderate alcohol use, living alone, and self-reported health were inversely associated. Being underweight, overweight, or obese all carried significantly higher risk of frailty than normal weight. Baseline frailty independently predicted risk of death (hazard ratio (HR)=1.71, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.48-1.97), hip fracture (HR=1.57, 95\% CI=1.11-2.20), ADL disability (odds ratio (OR)=3.15, 95\% CI=2.47-4.02), and hospitalizations (OR=1.95, 95\% CI=1.72-2.22) after adjustment for demographic characteristics, health behaviors, disability, and comorbid conditions.
CONCLUSION: These results support the robustness of the concept of frailty as a geriatric syndrome that predicts several poor outcomes in older women. Underweight, obesity, smoking, and depressive symptoms are strongly associated with the development of frailty and represent important targets for prevention.},

Frail patients are vulnerable to undergoing adverse events, to developing geriatric syndromes and to experiencing functional decline during or due to hospitalization. The strategy for providing specialized geriatric care to these hospitalized frail elderly patients currently consists of care provision either by specialized departments or by specialized teams who adopt comprehensive geriatric assessment. Even so, financial and human resources are insufficient to meet the needs of all hospitalized frail elderly patients who require comprehensive geriatric assessment. New innovative and more efficient geriatric interventions, in which the priorities of the patients themselves should be the main focus, should be developed and implemented, and professionals in all specialties should be educated in applying the fundamentals of geriatric medicine to their frail elderly patients. In the evaluation of such interventions, patient-reported outcomes should play a major role, in addition to the more traditional outcome measures of effectiveness, quality of care and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12\% (181); "1-2", 26\% (225); "3-4", 52\% (71); and "greater than or equal to 5", 85\% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "0", 8\% (588); "1", 25\% (54); "2", 48\% (25); "greater than or equal to 3", 59\% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank chi 2 = 165; p less than 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p less than 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the protective effect of metformin against death is modified by frailty status in older adults with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cohort study during October 1, 1999-September 30, 2006 among veterans aged 65-89 years old with type 2 diabetes but without history of liver, renal diseases, or cancers, who had sulfonylureas or metformin as the sole antidiabetic drug for $\geq$180 days. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare hazard rates of all-cause mortality between the metformin and sulfonylurea users adjusting for the propensity score of metformin use and covariates: age, race/ethnicity, diabetes duration, Charlson comorbidity score, statin use, smoking status, BMI, LDL, and HbA1c.
RESULTS: In this cohort of 2,415 veterans, 307 (12.7\%) were metformin users, 2,108 (87.3\%) were sulfonylurea users, the mean age was 73.7$\pm$5.2 years, the mean study period was 5.6$\pm$2.3 years, the mean HbA1c at baseline was 6.7$\pm$1.0\%, 23\% had diabetes for $\geq$10 years, and 43.6\% (N=1,048) died during the study period. For patients with and without frailty, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of death for metformin vs. sulfonylurea use were 0.92 (95\% CI=0.90-1.31, p-value=0.19) and 0.69 (95\% CI = 0.60-0.79, p-value$<$0.001), respectively. Logistic regression analyses showed that metformin (vs. sulfonylurea) was significantly associated with a decreased odds of frailty (OR: 0.66, 95\% CI: 0.61-0.71, p-value $<$.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that metformin could potentially promote longevity via preventing frailty in older adults with type 2 diabetes.},

  issn = {1079-5006},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many definitions of frailty exist, but few have been directly compared. We compared the relationship between a definition of frailty based on a specific phenotype with one based on an index of deficit accumulation.
METHODS: The data come from all 2305 people 70 years old and older who composed the clinical examination cohort of the second wave of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging. We tested convergent validity by correlating the measures with each other and with other health status measures, and analyzed cumulative index distributions in relation to phenotype. To test criterion validity, we evaluated survival (institutionalization and all-cause mortality) by frailty index (FI) score, stratified by the phenotypic definitions as "robust," "pre-frail," and "frail."
RESULTS: The measures correlated moderately well with each other (R=0.65) and with measures of function (phenotypic definition R=0.66; FI R=0.73) but less well with cognition (phenotypic definition R=-0.35; FI R=-0.58). The median FI scores increased from 0.12 for the robust to 0.30 for the pre-frail and 0.44 for the frail. Survival was also lower with increasing frailty, and institutionalization was more common, but within each phenotypic class, there were marked differences in outcomes based on the FI values-e.g., among robust people, the median 5-year survival for those with lower FI values was 85\%, compared with 55\% for those with higher FI values.
CONCLUSION: The phenotypic definition of frailty, which offers ready clinical operationalization, discriminates broad levels of risk. The FI requires additional clinical translation, but allows the risk of adverse outcomes to be defined more precisely.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The increasing number of elderly and comorbid patients undergoing surgical procedures raises interest in better identifying patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality, independent of age. Frailty has been identified as a predictor of surgical complications.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the implications of frailty as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in inpatient otolaryngologic operations.
DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records.
SETTING: National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) participating hospitals.
PATIENTS: NSQIP participant use files were used to identify 6727 inpatients who underwent operations performed by surgeons specializing in otolaryngology between 2005 and 2010. The study sample was 50.3\% male and 10.2\% African American, with a mean (range) age of 54.7 (16-90) years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A previously described modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated on the basis of NSQIP variables. The effect of increasing frailty on morbidity and mortality was evaluated using univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare mFI with age, ASA, and wound classification. RESULTS The mean (range) mFI was 0.07 (0-0.73). As the mFI increased from 0 (no frailty-associated variables) to 0.45 (5 of 11) or higher, mortality risk increased from 0.2\% to 11.9\%. The risk of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications increased from 1.2\% to 26.2\%. The risk of all complications increased from 9.5\% to 40.5\%. All results were significant at P $<$\,.001. In a multivariate logistic regression model to predict mortality or serious complication, mFI became the dominant significant predictor.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The mFI is significantly associated with morbidity and mortality in this retrospective survey. Additional study with prospective analysis and external validation is needed. The mFI may provide an improved understanding of preoperative risk, which would facilitate perioperative optimization, risk stratification, and counseling related to outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Risk-adjusted mortality and morbidity rates are often used as measures of the quality of surgical care. This study was conducted to determine the validity of risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates as measures of quality of care by assessing the process and structure of care in surgical services with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and morbidity rates.
STUDY DESIGN: A structural survey of 44 Veterans Affairs Medical Center surgical services and site visits to 20 surgical services with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected risk-adjusted outcomes were conducted. Main outcome measures included assessment of technology and equipment, technical competence of staff, leadership, relationship with other services, monitoring of quality of care, coordination of work, relationship with affiliated institutions, and overall quality of care.
RESULTS: Surgical services with lower-than-expected risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates had significantly more equipment available in surgical intensive care units than did services with higher-than-expected outcomes (4.3 versus 2.9, p $<$ 0.05). Site-visitor ratings of overall quality of care were significantly higher for surgical services with lower-than-expected morbidity and mortality rates (6.1 versus 4.5 for high outliers, p $<$ 0.05); technology and equipment were rated significantly better among low-outlier services (7.1 versus 4.8 for high outliers, p $<$ 0.001). Masked site-visit teams correctly predicted the outlier status (high versus low) of 17 of the 20 surgical services visited (p $<$ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in several dimensions of process and structure of the delivery of surgical care are associated with differences in risk-adjusted surgical morbidity and mortality rates among 44 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.},

Valid inferences from such data require the ability to account for disease severity and comorbid conditions. We adapted a clinical comorbidity index, designed for use with medical records, for research relying on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes. The association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). The index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. These associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. They also persisted after controlling for patient age. We conclude that the adapted comorbidity index will be useful in studies of disease outcome and resource use employing administrative databases.},

  doi = {10.1097/TA.0b013e31824d0f70},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colectomy patients experience a broad set of adverse outcomes. Complications requiring critical care support are common in this group. We hypothesized that as frailty increases, the risk of Clavien class IV and V complications will increase in colectomy patients.
METHODS: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) participant use files for 2005-2009, we identified patients who underwent laparoscopic and open colectomies by Current Procedural Terminology code. Using the Clavien classification for postoperative complications, we identified NSQIP data points most consistent with Clavien class IV requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care or class V complications (death). We used a modified frailty index with 11 variables based on mapping the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index and existing NSQIP variables. Logistic regression was performed to acuity adjust the findings.
RESULTS: A total of 58,448 colectomies were identified. As frailty index increased from 0 to 0.55, the proportion of those experiencing Clavien class IV or V complications increased from 3.2\% at baseline to 56.3\%. Variables found to be significant by logistic regression (odds ratio) were frailty index (14.4; p = 0.001), open procedure (2.35; p $<$ 0.001), and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (3.2; p = 0.038) or 5 (7.1; p = 0.001) while emergency operation and wound classification 3 or 4 were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Complications requiring ICU care represent a significant morbidity in the colectomy patient population. Frailty index seems to be an important predictor of ICU-level complications and death, and laparoscopy seems to be protective.},
